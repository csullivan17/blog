# sec_soccer
I was inspired by 538's college football prediction tool to create this to explore possible tournament seeding results ahead of the last day of regualar season SEC soccer before the conference tournament. I thought it would be fun to build this and have it to use in other sports moving forward, on top of just giving me a fun project.
